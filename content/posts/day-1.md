## Introduction: Who am I?

# My name is **xolos**, pronounced z-oh-l-oh-s.

I am a programmer from the **United Kingdom** ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. 

- [X] Python
- [X] Lua

My operating system is **Arch Linux**, running on [**Hyprland**](https://hyprland.org/) compositor.

# What are my goals.

My goals are to become a Mechanical Engineer in the future, potentially studying at Cambridge, Oxford or Imperial College London. I also intend to promote the use of Open-Source Software, as I believe proprietary software hinders the ability of users' creative freedom, and blurs the line between privacy and publicity.
